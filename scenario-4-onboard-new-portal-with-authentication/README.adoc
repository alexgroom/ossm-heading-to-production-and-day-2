== Requirements focused on new Business Opportunity setup

The `Travel Agency` business development department has managed to strike a new business deal:

1. The _Global Travel Organization(GTO)_ will source travel offers via _Travel Services Domain_ APIs.
2. The _Security Team_ requires all communications with the external client to be performed over `MUTUAL TLS`.
3. The _Platform Team_ wishes to enable further `authentication` with a valid JWT token in order to exercise possible `authorization` policies in the future.

== Configure additional ingress for _Travel Agency API_ Services

* Define URL of the CLUSTER for the users to login at

* The result is a new pod for `gto-external-ingressgateway` is created, a TLS passthrough Route to expose access to it and an Istio config `travel-api-gateway` which defines the MUTUAL TLS requirement and the secret which will contain the certificates and keys.

== Use JWT authentication

The intended final workflow of authentication for the `GTO` requests with a `JWT` token is as follows (*Note:* this is in addition to the mTLS handshake):

0. the user authenticates to RHSSO and get a JWT token (not shown in the above picture);
1. the user performs an HTTP request to `https://<route>/travels` (or one of `cars`, `hotels`, `insurances`, `flights`) and passes along this request the JWT token;
3. The 'istio-proxy' container of the 'gto-external-ingressgateway' POD checks the validity of the JWT token as defined by the 'RequestAuthentication' object and permissions defined in the 'AuthorizationPolicy' object.
4. if the JWT token is valid, user accesses the `/PATH` - otherwise, an error message is returned to the user (code `403`, message `RBAC denied` or others).

* Pros:
** the simplest approach (only 2 CR to be deployed)
** fine-grained authorization based on JWT token fields
* Cons:
** no OIDC workflow: the user must get a JWT token on its own, and pass it with the HTTP request on its own
** need to define `RequestAuthentication` and `AuthorizationPolicy` objects for each application to protect inside the service mesh


=== Setup Red Hat Signle Sign-On Server (RHSSO)

[NOTE]

Actions with role `Cluster Admin`

* Complete pre-requisites (*NOTE:* if you don't have `sed` utility in your path you need to perform the replacement by hand)

=== Mount RHSSO TLS Certificate to Istiod

[NOTE]
====
Actions with role `Cluster Admin`
====

* Mount Openshift ingress routers CA certificate in istiod. When deploying `RequestAuthentication` object,
Istiod will be in charge of verifying the connection to RHSSO. This step is performed during initialization only
(`RequestAuthentication` object creation). Since RHSSO is exposed behind a route, we need to add the Openshift
ingress routers CA certificate to istiod so it can verify the TLS certificate for the RHSSO route.
----
./login-as.sh phillip
./scripts/mount-rhsso-cert-to-istiod.sh prod-istio-system production <CLUSTERNAME> <BASEDOMAIN>
----

=== Create `RequestAuthentication` and `AuthorizationPolicy` to ALLOW access for `gto-external` user `gtouser`

* The created `RequestAuthentication` object enforces in `Istio` that only _JWT_ tokens issued by the RHSSO will be used to
authenticate/authorize user requests for `cars`, `travels`, `hotels`, `insurances` and `flights`.
* The created `AuthenticationPolicy` object has the effect that in order fo a _JWT_ token, to be valid, must be issued by our RHSSO (During prerequisites phase, we created a user localuser inside RHSSO, and this user has the address gtouser@gto.com).

[NOTE]
====
Actions with role `Mesh Operator`
====

* As these are applied on the newly create `gto-external-ingressgateway` in `prod-istio-system` it will be applied by *emma* the Mesh Operator
----
./login-as.sh emma
oc -n prod-istio-system apply -f approach_1/yaml/istio/jwt/01_requestauthentication.yaml
oc -n prod-istio-system apply -f approach_1/yaml/istio/jwt/02_authpolicy_allow_from_servicemesh-lab_realm.yaml
----
* The result will be for any request coming in via `gto-external` Route and then hitting the `gto-external-ingressgateway` to be intercepted and required to contain beyond the TLS certificate for `mTLS` on the `Gateway` an additional `JWT` valid token before the request is allowed to proceed.
+
image::../images/gto-RequestAuthentication-AuthorizationPolicy.png[400,1000]


=== Access `gto-external` exposed _Travel Agency APIs_ with JWT

* First, ensure that you cannot access anymore the `travels`, `cars` applications without a valid `JWT` token (it might take a few seconds for the changes to apply)
+
----
export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc -n prod-istio-system get route gto-external -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
----


* Retrieve a JWT token for user gtouser from RHSSO and use that during _Travel Agency API_ calls
** Note: the <CLIENT_SECRET> must be replaced with the client secret of the RHSSO client created during prerequisites phase (see link:prerequisites/yaml/rhsso/03_istio-client.yaml[03_istio-client.yaml]).
+
----

https://keycloak-rhsso.apps.<CLUSTERNAME>.<BASEDOMAIN>/auth/realms/servicemesh-lab/protocol/openid-connect/token \
| jq .access_token)

echo $TOKEN
----

* Finally, use this JWT token to access as `GTO` user the _Travel Agency APIs_
